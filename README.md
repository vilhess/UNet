# Crack Segmentation with U-Net in PyTorch

## Overwiew
This repository contains the implementation of a U-Net model for crack segmentation in images using PyTorch. The U-Net architecture is widely used for semantic segmentation tasks, and it has shown promising results in various computer vision applications.

## Download data
To download the data, run the following command :
`python get_data.py`
It will download and unzip the data in a new folder called `data`

## Notebook
In order to run the notebook, you have to download the dependencies and to set the device in the notebook (I use `MPS` for mac m1 pro)
